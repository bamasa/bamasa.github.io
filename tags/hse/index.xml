      <description>TL; DR We made Space Navigator - a system for automatically determining the probability of collision of space objects and calculating the most effective evasive maneuver using AI.
Stage of the project:
 Research Article (2020) MVP (2019) First place in the competition of projects of the Academy of Roscosmos (presentation slides, 2018) VR presentation (2018)  Demonstrations and reports:
 &amp;ldquo;SMILES&amp;rdquo;, summer school (Moscow, Skoltech, 2020) &amp;ldquo;Space debris: fundamental and practical aspects of the threat&amp;rdquo;, Russian conference with international participation (Moscow, Institute of Astronomy RAS and Space Research Institute RAS, 2019) &amp;ldquo;IAA SciTech Forum&amp;rdquo;, international conference (Moscow, RUDN, 2018)  Mentions:</description>

      <description>Participated in the international summer school SMILES – The Summer School of Machine Learning at Skoltech from 16 to 21 August 2020. In the poster session, I talked about two &amp;ldquo;AI &amp;amp; Satellite Problems&amp;rdquo; projects that we were engaged at the Laboratory of Methods for Big Data Analysis  at the National Research University Higher School of Economics.
Below is the submitted poster and the certificate provide.
