      <description>TL; DR We made Space Navigator - a system for automatically determining the probability of collision of space objects and calculating the most effective evasive maneuver using AI.
Stage of the project:
 Research Article (2020) MVP (2019) First place in the competition of projects of the Academy of Roscosmos (presentation slides, 2018) VR presentation (2018)  Demonstrations and reports:
 &amp;ldquo;SMILES&amp;rdquo;, summer school (Moscow, Skoltech, 2020) &amp;ldquo;Space debris: fundamental and practical aspects of the threat&amp;rdquo;, Russian conference with international participation (Moscow, Institute of Astronomy RAS and Space Research Institute RAS, 2019) &amp;ldquo;IAA SciTech Forum&amp;rdquo;, international conference (Moscow, RUDN, 2018)  Mentions:</description>

  I took a course on Ð¡omputer Vision from OTUS (in Russian) from April 28 to September 25, 2020. The course was practical and covered Neural Networks and Deep Learning in the field of Computer Vision - from the basics to the latest frameworks and state-of-the-art scientific articles. Besides that, there were cool lessons about TensorRT and Server Inference. In addition, the interesting thing about this course was to learn from the experience of colleagues who use Computer Vision in different fields.</description>
